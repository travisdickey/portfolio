I am an educator. I love to learn and share my learning with others. I invite you to look over my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1086YgpvaIQyzSRGsX0lePI75rDjMVRSR/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} and explore the samples in this [portfolio](https://travisdickey.github.io/portfolio) to get a feel for who I am and the type of work I do.

I have spent 20+ years in K-12 schools, the past 11 as a leader. I started out as an English teacher and coach and held a couple of public relations positions before moving into leadership. Currently, I am an Assistant Principal, leading the [Effingham College & Career Academy's](https://www.effinghamschools.com/Domain/1611){:target="_blank"} pursuit toward STEM certifiation. 

Outside of work, I enjoy my family, playing tennis, and pursuing whatever learning challenges strike my fancy. I love to read, particularly literary nonfiction. A few years ago, I began to venture into new learning territory, narrating a few audibooks under the pseudonym [Wayne Paige](https://www.audible.com/search?ref=a_search_c1_sort_1&pf_rd_p=073d8370-97e5-4b7b-be04-aa06cf22d7dd&pf_rd_r=6G2XTAKQZR1W6DD4N5Z7&searchNarrator=Wayne+Paige&feature_seven_browse-bin=9178191011&feature_seven_browse-bin=9178192011&feature_seven_browse-bin=9178193011&sort=pubdate-desc-rank){:target="_blank"}. Strangely enough, this led me to an interest in data science, machine learning, and deep learning, so for the past three years, I have pursued that interest through courses at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/courses/all){:target="_blank"}[^1] and [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai){:target="_blank"}[^2] and data science competitions at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/twdickey43){:target="_blank"}[^3].
